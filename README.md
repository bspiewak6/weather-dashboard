## Requirements
1. The user will utilize the weather dashboard to check out the weather for a particular city of interest. 
2. When the user searches for the city, they are shown current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
3. The user is presented with the city name, the date and an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV index.
    * When viewing the UV index, the user sees a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate or severe. 
4. Then, the user has the ability to view future weather conditions for the city they chose and they are shown a 5-day forecast.
    * The 5-day forecast includes the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature and humidity.
5. Lastly, the user can click on the city in the search history to again be shown the current and future weather conditions for that city.

## Additional
1. This was the first application that I built using an API. The app retrieves data from a third-party weather API called OpenWeather API.
